Look this project for a 8th grader who barely knows how to code is just crazy!
This is my first "big" project for me so please don't judge harshly on my code.
I know I could have made the code a bit more beautiful with OOP but at the start of the project, I was just a bit "unexperienced".
So far, creating this tool is my pleasure!
To run the project, just download the zip, and run the executable!
